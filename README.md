# Lexical Syntax Checker
Overview
The Lexical Syntax Checker is a Java program designed to verify the syntactical correctness of source code written in a specific programming language. It examines the arrangement of tokens within the code to ensure it conforms to expected syntax rules.

Functionality
The program performs the following tasks:

Tokenization:
It breaks down the source code into individual tokens, such as data types, identifiers, assignment operators, values, and delimiters.
Tokenization is the process of segmenting the code into meaningful units for syntactical analysis.

Syntactical Analysis:
It evaluates the sequence and structure of tokens to determine if they follow the grammar and syntax rules of the programming language.
Syntactical analysis checks for correct usage of language constructs, proper placement of symbols, and adherence to syntax rules.
Semantic Implications:

While the primary focus is on syntactical correctness, the program may also identify potential semantic issues.
Semantic implications involve understanding the meaning and context of the code to detect logical errors or inconsistencies.
